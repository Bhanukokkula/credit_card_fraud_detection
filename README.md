# credit_card_fraud_detection
# Overview
This project focuses on building a credit card fraud detection system using machine learning. The system aims to identify potentially fraudulent transactions by analyzing various features associated with credit card transactions. The project employs classification algorithms to differentiate between legitimate and fraudulent transactions.

## Features
- **Data Source:** The dataset used for this project contains information about credit card transactions, including transaction amount, time, and various features derived from the transaction details.

- **Algorithms:**
  - **Logistic Regression:** A binary classification algorithm used to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate.
  
  - **Random Forest:** An ensemble learning method utilizing multiple decision trees to improve the accuracy and robustness of the fraud detection model.

  - **XGBoost (optional):** An advanced boosting algorithm known for its high performance in classification tasks.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages can be installed using:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown
Copy code

## Data
- **credit_card_data.csv:** The dataset containing information about credit card transactions.

## Usage
1. **Data Preparation:**
 - Ensure the dataset is in the correct format and includes all necessary features.
 - Handle any missing values, encode categorical variables, and perform feature scaling if required.

2. **Training:**
 - Run the `train_logistic_regression.py`, `train_random_forest.py`, and optionally `train_xgboost.py` scripts to train the respective classification models on the prepared dataset.

3. **Prediction:**
 - Use the trained models to make predictions on new credit card transactions by running the `predict.py` script.

## Files
- **credit_card_data.csv:** Sample dataset containing credit card transaction information.
- **train_logistic_regression.py:** Script for training the Logistic Regression model.
- **train_random_forest.py:** Script for training the Random Forest model.
- **train_xgboost.py (optional):** Script for training the XGBoost model.
- **predict.py:** Script for making predictions using the trained classification models.
- **requirements.txt:** List of Python packages required for the project.

## Results
- Provide insights into the accuracy and performance of each classification model.
- Include relevant evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1-score) and possibly visualizations to demonstrate the effectiveness of the fraud detection system.

## Evaluation
- Evaluate the model's performance on both training and testing datasets.

## Future Work
- Discuss potential improvements or enhancements that can be made to the fraud detection system.
- Consider experimenting with different classification algorithms, feature engineering, or incorporating additional features.
